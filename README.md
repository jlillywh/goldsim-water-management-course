## üö® CRITICAL: Development Workflows for Lesson Management

### **‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY WORKFLOW: Always Update Documentation After Lesson Changes**

**EVERY TIME** you create, edit, or modify any lesson file, you **MUST** run the documentation update:

```batch
run_update.bat
```

This single command will:
- ‚úÖ Update README.md with current course structure
- ‚úÖ Update ASSETS_NEEDED.md with current lesson counts
- ‚úÖ Synchronize lesson counts and links
- ‚úÖ Maintain accurate course documentation

### **Essential Lesson Management Commands**

#### 1. **Documentation Update Only** (Most Common)
Use when you've manually created/edited lesson files and need to sync documentation:
```batch
run_update.bat
```

#### 2. **Insert Lesson + Auto-Renumber** (Advanced)
Use when inserting a lesson between existing lessons:
```batch
run_update.bat [lesson_number]
# Example: run_update.bat 3  (inserts after lesson 3, renumbers rest)
```

#### 3. **Manual Course Outline Generation**
Direct access to outline generator:
```batch
python generate_course_outline.py --update-readme
```

#### 4. **Safe Lesson Renumbering** (Use with Caution)
For complex renumbering operations:
```batch
python renumber_lessons.py [insertion_point] --force
```

### **Lesson File Naming Convention**

**CRITICAL:** All lesson files MUST follow the UU-LL-lesson-title.md format:
- UU = Unit number (01, 02, 03...)
- LL = Lesson number within unit (01, 02, 03...)
- Example: `02-09-incorporating-climate-model-projections.md`

### **Required Workflow for New Conversations**

üî• **FOR ALL FUTURE CONVERSATIONS INVOLVING LESSON MANAGEMENT:**

1. **After creating any new lesson file**: Run `run_update.bat`
2. **After editing existing lessons**: Run `run_update.bat` 
3. **After renumbering lessons**: Run `run_update.bat`
4. **Before completing any lesson-related task**: Verify README.md is updated

### **Quality Assurance Checklist**

Before considering any lesson work complete:
- [ ] New/modified lesson files follow naming convention
- [ ] `run_update.bat` has been executed successfully
- [ ] README.md reflects all changes
- [ ] Course outline shows correct lesson count
- [ ] All lesson links are functional

### **Backup and Safety**

The automation system includes:
- **Automatic backups** before any renumbering operations
- **Dry-run validation** for all file operations
- **Rollback capability** if operations fail
- **Error handling** with clear failure messages

### **File Structure Management**
