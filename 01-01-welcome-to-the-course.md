# Lesson 1: Welcome to the Course


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- **Describe** the structure and goals of the GoldSim Water Management Course
- **Identify** the prerequisites and target audience for the course
- **Explain** the value of dynamic simulation for water management
- **Outline** the key topics and learning approach used in the course


## Context / Overview

Water management challenges are increasingly complex, requiring robust tools and methods to support sound engineering decisions. This course introduces you to GoldSim—a leading dynamic simulation platform—by guiding you through the essential concepts, workflows, and best practices for modeling real-world water systems. Whether you are a consultant, engineer, or researcher, this course will help you build the skills needed to analyze, design, and optimize water management solutions using GoldSim.


## Technical Content

### Course Structure and Approach
The GoldSim Water Management Course is organized into 12 progressive units, each building on the last. You will start with foundational concepts and data preparation, then advance through climate modeling, surface and groundwater hydrology, demand analysis, reservoir operations, and risk assessment. Each unit features hands-on lessons, practical exercises, and real-world examples.

### Who Should Take This Course?
This course is designed for:
- Water resource engineers, environmental consultants, and mining engineers with prior GoldSim experience
- Graduate students and professionals seeking to model complex, integrated water systems
- Regulatory professionals and planners evaluating water system models

**Prerequisites:**
- Minimum 40 hours of GoldSim modeling or completion of the Basic GoldSim Course
- Familiarity with hydrological concepts and engineering mathematics

### Why Use GoldSim for Water Management?
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Visualize how water systems evolve over time
- **Uncertainty Analysis:** Quantify and manage variability in climate, demand, and system parameters
- **Data Integration:** Connect with Excel, databases, and other data sources
- **Visual Modeling:** Build and communicate models using an intuitive, graphical interface

### Learning Approach
The course emphasizes hands-on, problem-centered learning. You will build models step-by-step, apply best practices, and analyze real-world scenarios. Each lesson includes practical exercises and opportunities for self-assessment.


## Exercise / Activities

### Exercise: Course Orientation
1. **Review** the course outline and unit descriptions provided above.
2. **Verify** you meet the prerequisites (GoldSim experience, hydrology background, software access).
3. **Reflect:** Why is dynamic simulation important for your work or studies? Write a brief statement (2-3 sentences).
4. **Explore** the GoldSim interface: Open GoldSim, create a new model, and locate the key elements (Containers, Data, Expression, Result).
5. **Analysis Question:** What are two advantages of using GoldSim for water management modeling compared to spreadsheet-based approaches?


## Key Takeaways / Summary

- The course provides a structured, hands-on introduction to dynamic water management modeling with GoldSim
- Targeted at professionals and advanced students with prior modeling experience
- Emphasizes real-world application, uncertainty analysis, and best practices
- Each lesson builds skills progressively, with practical exercises and self-assessment
