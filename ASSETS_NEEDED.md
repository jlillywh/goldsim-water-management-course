## TODO: Research and Development Tasks

### High Priority - Climate Data Sources Research
**Task:** Research and identify sources for pre-processed climate data for Lesson 02-09
**Due:** Before lesson implementation
**Details:**
- Find publicly available, pre-processed climate projection datasets suitable for water management applications
- Identify datasets that include both historical baselines and future scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP8.5)
- Focus on sources that provide daily time series data for precipitation and temperature
- Look for datasets that already include bias correction and statistical downscaling
- Investigate availability of pre-calculated PrecipGen parameter adjustments

**Potential Sources to Investigate:**
- **ClimateData.ca** (Canada) - Bias-corrected daily climate projections
- **NASA NEX-GDDP** - Global bias-corrected downscaled climate projections  
- **Climate Explorer (KNMI)** - European climate data service
- **USGS Water Resources Climate Change** - Hydrologic climate projections for US
- **World Bank Climate Change Portal** - Global climate data for development
- **CORDEX Regional Downscaling** - Regional climate projections worldwide
- **Australian Climate Projections** - Comprehensive climate data for Australia
- **ECAD (European Climate Assessment)** - European daily climate data

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Curated list of 3-5 reliable data sources with download procedures
- Sample datasets for a representative location (e.g., western US mining region)
- Documentation of data formats, spatial/temporal resolution, and processing methods
- Assessment of data quality and suitability for GoldSim integration
