# Lesson 2: Getting Started with Course Resources & Setup

Welcome to Lesson 2! Before diving into modeling concepts, let's get you set up with the essential resources and files you'll need throughout this course.

This lesson guides you through downloading course materials, understanding software requirements, and navigating helpful GoldSim resources.

## Download the Course Model Files (Required Action)
This is a hands-on course using numerous example GoldSim models (.gsm files) and exercises. It's critical that you download these files now so you can open, explore, and work with them as you progress through the lessons.

Download Link: [Link to the course zip file]

Instructions: Download the zip file and unzip it to a convenient location on your computer, such as your Desktop.

What's Inside the Course Folder
When you unzip the file, it will create a root folder named Water Management Course. Inside, you will find a structured set of resources organized by unit and lesson. The primary file types you will interact with are:

.gsm (GoldSim Model files): These are the main working models for exercises.

.gsp (GoldSim Player files): These allow you to view and run completed models without a full GoldSim license.

.xlsx, .csv (Data files): Supporting data, such as time series or parameters, used by the models.

The folder structure is organized logically as follows:

The folder structure is organized logically as follows:

```

## Check Your GoldSim Version (Required Action)

**Requirement:** The model files used in this course require the **latest version** of GoldSim.

You can find the latest version [here].

**Compatibility:** Please note that you will **not** be able to open the course examples and exercises in older versions of GoldSim.

## Understanding Course Examples & Resources

Now that you have the course files, let's review the types of examples used and other resources available to you:

### Hands-On Approach
This course emphasizes learning by doing. You are strongly encouraged to open the example models, read any accompanying documentation (often within the model itself or linked in the lesson), and actively experiment with them.

### Source of Examples
Many models used in this course are derived from examples found in the extensive **GoldSim Help Center** and **Model Library**. These resources contain models that are often more complex and application-focused than the basic examples included with the standard GoldSim installation.

### Focus of Course Examples
Water management modeling is vast. This course doesn't aim to cover every possible application. Instead, we focus on demonstrating:

- **Conceptual Models:** Understanding the fundamental building blocks and approaches for modeling water systems
- **Water Balance and Management Techniques:** Applying GoldSim to simulate and analyze common water resource management challenges

We specifically tackle problems that benefit from GoldSim's dynamic, probabilistic capabilities, which might be difficult to address with more specialized, single-purpose tools (like HEC-HMS for rainfall-runoff alone).

## Navigating the GoldSim Help Center

The GoldSim Help Center is a valuable resource you should familiarize yourself with. Key sections relevant to this course include:

### Library of Software Features
Articles and examples illustrating specific GoldSim functions.

### Library of Applications
Examples showing how GoldSim is used for specific applications. Sections heavily used in this course include:
- Hydrology
- Water Management  
- Hydraulics

### Webinar Archive
Recordings and models from past webinars covering various topics.
- [Link to Archive]
- [Link to Upcoming Webinars]

### Modeling Tips
Useful articles and pointers for building better GoldSim models.

Take some time to explore these resources as needed throughout the course.

## What to Expect in Each Lesson (Typical Structure)

As you move through the course units, lessons will typically include:

- **Example Models:** Pre-built models (from the folder you downloaded) demonstrating key concepts
- **Hands-On Exercises:** Opportunities to build your own simple models or modify existing ones
- **Unit Summaries:** Reinforcement of key takeaways at the end of each unit

## Conclusion

You should now have the course model files downloaded and unzipped, understand the required GoldSim version, and be aware of the helpful resources available in the GoldSim Help Center.

You're all set to dive into the core concepts! In the next lesson, we'll explore the fundamentals of water management system modeling using GoldSim.

## Exercise

Which of the following is a required action for you to take at the beginning of this course, as outlined in Lesson 2?

**A)** Purchase a GoldSim license, as the course models require a paid version.

**B)** Build your first simple GoldSim model from scratch before proceeding.

**C)** Download the course model files and ensure you are using the latest version of GoldSim.

**D)** Contact GoldSim support to set up your software environment.

---

**Correct Answer:** C) Download the course model files and ensure you are using the latest version of GoldSim.
