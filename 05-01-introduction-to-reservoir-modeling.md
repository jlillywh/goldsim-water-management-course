# Lesson 1: Introduction to Reservoir Modeling

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Use GoldSim's `Reservoir` element to model basic water storage systems
- Configure essential reservoir inputs including initial volume, capacity, and geometric properties
- Connect inflows, withdrawals, and physical processes to reservoir models
- Interpret key reservoir outputs including volume, spill rate, and withdrawal performance
- Build and run a complete reservoir simulation with time-varying inflows and demands

## Context: The Foundation of Water Storage Modeling

In Units 2-4, we developed comprehensive models of water supply (climate and surface flows) and water demand. Now we need to model the critical link between them: **water storage systems**. Reservoirs—from small farm ponds to massive multi-purpose dams—are humanity's primary tool for managing the timing and availability of water resources.

Understanding reservoir modeling is fundamental to water management because:
- **Supply-demand mismatches** are the norm rather than the exception in water systems
- **Storage systems** provide the buffer that enables reliable water delivery
- **Operational rules** governing reservoir releases determine system performance
- **Advanced analyses** like flood control and drought planning all depend on accurate reservoir representation

This lesson establishes the foundational principles that every subsequent reservoir modeling technique will build upon. Master these basics, and complex operational rules, multi-reservoir systems, and specialized applications become logical extensions.

## Technical Content

### The Reservoir as a Dynamic Integrator

The fundamental concept underlying all reservoir modeling is the **mass balance equation**. A reservoir's current state is simply the result of its starting condition plus all additions and subtractions over time:

```
Volume(t) = Initial_Volume + ∫[Inflows - Outflows] dt
```

GoldSim's `Reservoir` element is a sophisticated integrator that continuously solves this water balance equation throughout your simulation. You define the physical processes and operational rules, and GoldSim automatically tracks the resulting volume, water levels, and flows.

This integration capability makes the `Reservoir` element fundamentally different from static water balance calculations you might perform in spreadsheets. The reservoir "remembers" its state from timestep to timestep, enabling realistic simulation of storage dynamics, carryover effects, and multi-year droughts or wet periods.

### Essential Reservoir Inputs

#### Physical Configuration

**Initial Volume** establishes the reservoir's starting condition. This might represent:
- Current measured storage for operational models
- Average historical storage for planning studies  
- Empty conditions for worst-case drought analysis
- Full conditions for flood risk assessment

**Upper Bound (Capacity)** defines the maximum storage volume. When inflows would cause the reservoir to exceed this limit, the excess water becomes **spill**—uncontrolled overflow that represents flood releases or emergency spillway activation.

**Surface Area** defines the reservoir's water surface for calculating precipitation inputs and evaporation losses. Real reservoirs have complex bathymetry where surface area changes with water level, but we'll start with simplified constant area assumptions.

#### Hydrologic Inputs and Losses

**Inflows** represent streamflow entering the reservoir, typically from upstream catchments. This connects your reservoir model to the surface flow modeling techniques from Unit 3. Inflows are specified as volumetric flow rates (m³/s, cfs, etc.).

**Precipitation** adds water through direct rainfall on the reservoir surface. GoldSim calculates the volumetric contribution by multiplying precipitation rate (mm/day) by current surface area. This can be a significant input for large reservoirs during major storms.

**Evaporation** removes water from the reservoir surface. Like precipitation, GoldSim calculates volumetric losses by multiplying evaporation rate by surface area. For arid regions, evaporation can represent a major loss that significantly affects water balance.

**Withdrawal Requests** represent controlled releases to meet various demands—municipal water supply, irrigation, hydropower generation, environmental flows, etc. These connect your reservoir model to the demand modeling concepts from Unit 4.

### Key Reservoir Outputs

#### Storage and Water Level

**Volume** is the primary state variable, showing how storage changes over time in response to all inputs and outputs. This directly indicates the reservoir's ability to meet future demands and its vulnerability to drought.

**Elevation (or Stage)** converts volume to water surface elevation, critical for flood management, recreational access, and environmental impacts. This requires elevation-volume relationships from reservoir bathymetry.

#### Flow Outputs

**Total Outflow** represents all water leaving the reservoir from all sources—controlled withdrawals, spills, seepage losses, etc. This becomes inflow to downstream river reaches.

**Spill Rate** specifically tracks uncontrolled overflow when the reservoir exceeds capacity. This is crucial for:
- Dam safety analysis during extreme floods
- Environmental impact assessment of uncontrolled releases  
- Water supply planning to understand "lost" water during high inflow periods

**Withdrawal** shows actual controlled releases, which may be less than the withdrawal request if the reservoir lacks sufficient water. The difference between requested and actual withdrawals indicates shortage conditions.

### Reservoir Geometry and Level-Dependent Properties

Real reservoirs have complex shapes that dramatically affect their behavior. As water level changes:
- **Surface area** varies, affecting precipitation inputs and evaporation losses
- **Storage capacity** changes non-linearly with elevation
- **Outlet elevations** determine which withdrawal structures are available

For comprehensive reservoir modeling, these relationships are typically defined using **lookup tables** that specify Volume-Area-Elevation relationships derived from detailed bathymetric surveys.

For this introductory lesson, we'll use simplified constant surface area assumptions to focus on fundamental mass balance concepts. Advanced geometric considerations will be addressed in later lessons.

## Exercise: Building Your First Reservoir Model

This hands-on exercise walks you through creating a complete reservoir simulation, from basic setup to results analysis.

### Exercise Setup

We'll model a municipal water supply reservoir that:
- Serves a small city with steady water demands
- Receives variable inflows from upstream catchments  
- Must balance storage conservation with spill risk
- Operates without complex rules (covered in Lesson 2)

### Part 1: Model Creation and Basic Configuration

1. **Create New Model**
   - Open GoldSim and create a new model
   - Save as `Municipal_Reservoir.gsm`
   - Set simulation duration to 3 years with monthly timesteps

2. **Create the Reservoir Element**
   - Add a `Reservoir` element named `Supply_Reservoir`
   - **Initial Volume**: `75,000 m³` (75% of capacity)
   - **Upper Bound (Capacity)**: `100,000 m³`
   - **Surface Area**: `8,000 m²` (constant approximation)

### Part 2: Inflow Data Connection

3. **Create Inflow Time Series**
   - Add a `Time Series` element named `Catchment_Inflows`
   - Import data from `Municipal_Inflows.xlsx`
   - Verify units are in m³/s
   - Connect to the `Inflows` input of `Supply_Reservoir`

### Part 3: Water Demand Configuration

4. **Define Municipal Demand**
   - Create a `Data` element named `City_Demand`
   - Set constant value: `0.8 m³/s` (representing steady municipal use)
   - Connect to `Withdrawal Requests` input of `Supply_Reservoir`

### Part 4: Results Setup and Analysis

5. **Create Output Tracking**
   - Add a `Time History Result` element named `Reservoir_Performance`
   - Configure to plot these `Supply_Reservoir` outputs:
     - `Volume` (storage over time)
     - `Inflows` (catchment contributions)  
     - `Withdrawal` (actual supply delivered)
     - `Spill_Rate` (overflow losses)

6. **Run Simulation and Analyze**
   - Execute the 3-year simulation
   - Examine the `Reservoir_Performance` plots
   - Identify periods of:
     - **Storage drawdown** (low inflow periods)
     - **Recovery** (storage refilling after dry periods)
     - **Spill events** (excess water during high inflows)
     - **Supply reliability** (ability to meet full demand)

### Part 5: Scenario Analysis

7. **Test Drought Resilience**
   - Modify `City_Demand` to `1.2 m³/s` (50% demand increase)
   - Re-run simulation and compare results
   - Note any periods where `Withdrawal` < `Withdrawal Requests` (shortage indicators)

8. **Evaluate Storage Impact**
   - Change `Initial Volume` to `25,000 m³` (25% of capacity)
   - Re-run with original demand (`0.8 m³/s`)
   - Observe how starting conditions affect early simulation behavior

### Analysis Questions

After completing the exercise, consider these questions:

1. **Storage Patterns**: During which months does the reservoir typically gain vs. lose storage? How does this relate to regional climate patterns?

2. **Spill Analysis**: When do spill events occur, and what does this suggest about system efficiency and flood risk?

3. **Demand Security**: Under what conditions does the reservoir fail to meet full demand? What early warning indicators precede shortage conditions?

4. **System Optimization**: How might you modify the reservoir capacity or operational strategy to improve performance?

## Professional Application

Understanding basic reservoir behavior is essential for multiple aspects of water management:

**Water Supply Planning**: Reservoir storage analysis determines system yield and reliability under various demand scenarios and climate conditions.

**Flood Management**: Spill analysis identifies when reservoirs provide flood control benefits and when they may contribute to downstream flooding.

**Environmental Management**: Storage fluctuations affect aquatic habitats, water quality, and recreational access, requiring careful balance with water supply objectives.

**Infrastructure Design**: Reservoir capacity, outlet works sizing, and spillway design all depend on accurate simulation of storage dynamics and flow patterns.

**Emergency Response**: Understanding how quickly reservoirs respond to extreme events enables better drought and flood emergency planning.

**Economic Analysis**: Storage behavior directly affects the costs and benefits of water supply systems, informing investment decisions and rate structures.
